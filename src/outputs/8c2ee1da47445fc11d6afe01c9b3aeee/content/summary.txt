ABSTRACT
Reading, much like music listening, is an immersive ex-
perience that transports readers while taking them on an
emotional journey. Listening to complementary music has
the potential to amplify the reading experience, especially
when the music is stylistically cohesive and emotionally
relevant. In this paper, we propose the first fully automatic
method to build a dense soundtrack for books, which can
play high-quality instrumental music for the entirety of the
reading duration. Our work employs a unique text pro-
cessing and music weaving pipeline that determines the
context and emotional composition of scenes in a chap-
ter. This allows our method to identify and play relevant
excerpts from the soundtrack of the book’s movie adap-
tation. By relying on the movie composer’s craftsman-
ship, our book soundtracks include expert-made motifs and
other scene-specific musical characteristics. We validate
the design decisions of our approach through a perceptual
study. Our readers note that the book soundtrack greatly
enhanced their reading experience, due to high immersive-
ness granted via uninterrupted and style-consistent music,
and a heightened emotional state attained via high preci-
sion emotion and scene context recognition.

Main Concepts:

- Proposes an automated method to build a dense soundtrack for books using movie adaptations
- Reading books is an immersive experience similar to listening to music
- Complementary music can enhance the reading experience if it is stylistically and emotionally relevant
- The method identifies relevant excerpts from the movie soundtrack to match parts of the book
- Relies on the craftsmanship of the movie composer for high quality music
- Validated through a perceptual study showing the soundtrack enhances reading immersion and emotion

Key Methods:

- Segment the book chapters, movie scenes, and soundtrack tracks into smaller coherent chunks
- Align the book chapters to movie scenes at both coarse and fine levels
- Extract emotion labels for book segments and music segments
- Match book segments to movie scenes and extract music playing in those scenes
- Use emotion matching to fill gaps where book segments don't align to movie scenes
- Weave together movie-matched and emotion-matched music segments into full soundtrack

Overall, the paper proposes a novel approach to automatically construct an immersive soundtrack for books by leveraging movie adaptations. It aligns the narrative elements across the book and movie in order to lift musically relevant segments from the movie soundtrack. A user study validates that this approach enhances the reading experience.

Human:Plan a 6 page zine of the paper in a 'idk' style with the aim of creating a zine that offers an overview ( outlines the main objectives and scope). The text and the images of the zine however should be purely academic - covering the main concepts and equations. Do not build a story, analogy or metaphor in the text or image prompts. The image prompts should be very explicit with obviously visualizable wording. The images prompts should all have a consistent color palette.. For each page of the zine, provide thorough text summaries of the concepts discussed (not just description of the text). Additionally, include ideas for images and a description of the style of the images. All images should maintain a consistent style. The zine should begin with a title on the first page and conclude with its abstract on the last page

Assistant:Here is a plan for a 6 page academic zine on the paper:

Page 1 (Title Page):
Sonus Texere! 
Title in a fun, stylized font. Image could be a stack of books with music notes floating above them. 

Page 2 (Introduction):
Text summarizing the introduction and context. Main points:
- Books are immersive like music
- Music can enhance reading experience 
- Proposing automated method to build book soundtrack using movie adaptation

Image could be someone reading a book with music notes and movie film floating around them.

Page 3 (Methods - Segmentation):
Text describing the segmentation of book chapters, movie scenes, and soundtrack tracks into smaller chunks. Equations for book and music segmentation.

Image showing book, movie, and music symbols being split into pieces.

Page 4 (Methods - Alignment): 
Text on aligning book to movie and movie to soundtrack. Description of coarse chapter-scene and fine paragraph-scene alignment.

Image of book and movie symbols lined up together.

Page 5 (Methods - Soundtrack Assembly): 
Text explaining assembling soundtrack using movie and emotion matches.

Image of music notes coming together into a soundtrack.

Page 6 (Conclusion):
Abstract reprinted verbatim.

Image similar to title page, closing the loop.

All images use a consistent, academic-looking flat illustration style with solid colors. The text is technical and academic, avoiding storytelling. The zine flows logically from introduction to methods to conclusion.
